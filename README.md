# Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis
Customer segmentation is simply dividing the target market into smaller groups that have similar attributes or characteristics. This gives a business more ammunition to know clients at a more intimate level, thus able to offer much-needed competitive advantage in exploring new markets and products. 

It is also a given that Customer Experience will most likely improve because the understanding of customer needs and preferences affords you a better chance of serving clients better in comparison to an entity that is clueless about their clientâ€™s attributes. 

But how can we use a data-driven approach to do the customer segmentation for a business? This workbook will illustrate the RFM analysis for customer segmentation on online retail data to help you better understand everything beneath.

## Business Scenario <a name="case"></a>
Let's assume we are running a e-commerce company, and we would love to segment our customers. So that we can propose our pricing strategy for each group based on our findings on the customer segmentation.

In this case, we will be using a set of transactional-level data, to extract the features based on clients' order history and perform further analysis.

The data is available at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail+II

This Online Retail II data set contains all the transactions occurring for a UK-based and registered, non-store online retail between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011. The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gift-ware. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.
