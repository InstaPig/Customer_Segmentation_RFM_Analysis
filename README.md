# Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis
## Overview
Customer segmentation is simply dividing the target market into smaller groups that have similar attributes or characteristics. This gives a business more ammunition to know clients at a more intimate level, thus able to offer much-needed competitive advantage in exploring new markets and products. 

It is also a given that Customer Experience will most likely improve because the understanding of customer needs and preferences affords you a better chance of serving clients better in comparison to an entity that is clueless about their client’s attributes. 

But how can we use a data-driven approach to do the customer segmentation for a business? This workbook will illustrate the **RFM analysis** for customer segmentation on online retail data to help you better understand everything beneath.

## What is RFM Analysis?
RFM analysis is a marketing technique used to quantitatively rank and group customers based on the **Recency**, **Frequency** and **Monetary** total of their recent transactions to identify the best customers and perform targeted marketing campaign. Each of these metrics represents customer trait.

- **Recency**: The time been since customer's last purchase
- **Frequency**: The total number of orders placed by the same customer
- **Monetary**: The aggregated monetary volume of a client's historical purchase

With the above metrics defined, we can assign scores to the customers to represent their trait. As an example, a customer who purchased one day ago will recieve a Recency score of 5, while someone who's last order is from one year before woule be assigned a score of 1. Now, with transactional-level value converted to RFM scores, it increases the comparability across each class. Thus, we can use the combination of customers' R, F, M rankings to implement the segmentaions.

In the following part, we will be seeing how exactly the RFM analysis are conducted based on transactional-level data.

## Business Scenario <a name="case"></a>
Let's assume we are running a e-commerce company, and we would love to segment our customers. So that we can propose our pricing strategy for each group based on our findings on the customer segmentation.

In this case, we will be using a set of transactional-level data, to extract the features based on clients' order history and perform further analysis.

The data is available at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail+II

This Online Retail II data set contains all the transactions occurring for a UK-based and registered, non-store online retail between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011. The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gift-ware. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.
